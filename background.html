			<h2> MIGRATION: <br> FROM MEXICO TO THE US </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p> The story of my family's migration to the United States has been a significant part of my life. My parents made the difficult decision to leave their home in search of a better life for themselves and their future family. My mother crossed the border while seven months pregnant with me, facing countless dangers and uncertainties along the way.
				As I grew older, my parents shared their story with me, and I came to understand the immense sacrifice and courage it took for them to make the journey. They faced discrimination and hardship upon arriving in the United States, but they were determined to provide a better life for themselves and their children.
				Despite the challenges, my family persevered, and I was born in the United States, becoming the first in my family to be a citizen. My parents worked tirelessly to provide for our family, and they instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the opportunity to continuously learn. </p>

			<h2> MIGRATION: <br> MOVING TO CHICAGO </h2>

		<div class="description">
			<p> Accepted into the University of Illinois at Chicago's Engineering College, I came to the city. As a student in the Industrial Engineering program, I was challenged intellectually and personally. I was surrounded by students from all over the world, each with their own unique stories and backgrounds. I learned to work collaboratively and to think creatively, skills that have served me well throughout my academic and professional life.
				Attending UIC also gave me the opportunity to reconnect with the city of Chicago, a place that I had always felt a connection to. I explored the neighborhoods and communities that had shaped my parents' experiences, and I was inspired by the diversity and resilience of the city.  </p>

			<h2> ADVOCACY AS A CAREER: <br> THE DECISION TO PURSUE NON-PROFIT WORK </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>	My decision to pursue a career in non-profit work was influenced by my experiences growing up in a family that had faced significant challenges and obstacles. I sought out organizations that shared my vision, working with groups that focused on issues like affordable housing, healthcare access, and environmental justice. Working in the non-profit world has been challenging, but it has also been incredibly rewarding. I have had the opportunity to work with inspiring individuals and organizations, and to make a tangible impact in the lives of those around me. As I continue to pursue my career in non-profit work, I remain committed to a progressive vision of change, one in which we work together to build a more just and equitable world for all.	<p>
